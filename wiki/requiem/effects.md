Soul effects are special status effects that are bound to your very self.
They are kept with you when leaving a body, and cannot be cleared through normal means.

## Attrition
Attrition is primarily gained through the deaths of your bodies. As your ethereal self gets afflicted
with stronger attrition, your hosts will become weaker and weaker.

## Emancipation

Emancipation allows you to freely dissociate from your current body without having to die.
If you use it to dissociate as a regular player, you will leave behind a player shell.

## Penance

Penance is an effect that brings your soul away from the physical plane.
At level I, it prevents you from curing yourself.
At level II, it also separates you from your human shell.
At level III, it prevents you from getting a physical body entirely.

## Reclamation

Reclamation lets you slowly cure attrition without having to change bodies.
Each time the effect's timer runs out, a level of attrition will be removed.
